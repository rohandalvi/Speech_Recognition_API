Before you start with the project, you can just read a bit about the project here ( https://wiki.mozilla.org/SpeechAPI ).

Now, to actually use it, you need to first clone the git repo by using the following command in your terminal:
  
  $ git clone git@github.com:rohandalvi/Speech_Recognition_API.git

This will download the code to your /home folder.

To work with this, you will also need the Mozilla Build, learn more about getting the Mozilla build here ( https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Simple_Firefox_build ).

Once the build process is complete, first dry run the patch file, ensure it doesn't cause errors ( its a clean patch ). 
Still if there are errors, just check the corresponding .rej files and make desired corrections.
